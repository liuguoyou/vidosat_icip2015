Description:
-----

VIDOSAT is a video denoising framework based on online 3D spatio-temporal sparsifying transform learning. The proposed scheme has low computational and memory costs, and can potentially handle streaming video. Our numerical experiments show promising performance for the proposed video denoising method compared to popular prior or state-of-the-art methods.

The VIDOSAT package includes (1) a collection of the VIDOSAT Matlab functions, and (2) example demo data used in the VIDOSAT paper for video denoising.
